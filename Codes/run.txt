Definition WriteToCSV
It takes in XY coordinates and folder name specific to the iteration number.
It counts the no.of non zero spots with specific cell ID and stores the value for the respective cell type as a .csv file.

The for loop runs for 10 iterations
Folder is created with the name stored in FolderName variable.
XY grid is created.
Simulation library from Simulation.py is called to simulate the model.
CellType library from CellType.py is called to initialise the population in the grid.
Parameter values are given to use in the simulation.
Finally simulation is started and values for each time frame is stored in a .csv file.
A folder is created within each iteration folder to store the images at every 5hrs timeframe.
VideoMaker libray is called to generate te video using the saved images.
